# WebsiteForCovidBoredem
This is a website I created for my digital design summative in 9th grade at the age of 13. Using a template for CSS I edited the code for my own liking and embedded links and a live video. The website includes a for you page, covid updates, some websites for cure of boredem, and a home page.
