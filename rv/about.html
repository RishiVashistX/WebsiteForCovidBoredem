					<p>Rishi Vashist, a student at Pathways School Noida, he loves technology and he wants to do a good deed for the universe through the means of technology. He is ardent towards the subject of technological factors and loves web-designing, which he always has had a dote for. He's been passionate about technology since he got an Ipad at the age of 3 when his father showed him an Ipad and how to use it. After that there was no going back. It was just him and technology from then on. Rishi has always been keen about technology and wants to know its full potential. Hes a bright talented 13 year old who wants to create history through the means of technology. I am extremely excited to share this website with all of you. Hope it makes a difference&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
